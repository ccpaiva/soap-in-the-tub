This project contains an animated simulation of soap eroding on the floor of a shower.

To run the animation, install the 2 required libraries in requirements.txt and run:

```python gui.py```

There is also a gif added in the assets folder.

The `constants.py` file contains various coefficients that will affect the simulation. These are currently
optimized for a ~1 minute soap deterioration, but these can be altered to create a more realistic model.
